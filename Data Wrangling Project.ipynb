    "# Main Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem that I identified was a lack of data! Durban is the third largest city in South Africa. Given that South Africa is not a western country, I anticipated that there may not be as much awareness around the Open Street Map project. From my sample map and in terms of cleaning, I sought out the correct four issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Errors in Street Names\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the preamble to this project, there were various abbreviations or misspellings of street names. For example 'Rd' instead of 'Road' or 'Cresent' instead of 'Crescent'\n",
    "- #### Multiple Sport Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that several of the sports amenities had similar sport definitions and decided to homogenise this. For example there were tags with values 'canoe' and canoeing'\n",
    "- #### Missing Postcodes\n",
    "\n",
    "There were not many postcodes in the data set. This is partially because postcodes are not as important in South Africa as they are in typical western countries like the UK or US. Postcodes are allocated to an \"area\" (which in itself is defined vaguely but is typically a suburb in a city) however the name of the area is more important in the postal system than the postcode number. Postcodes may (but not definitely) refer to the type of address - for example a physical address or post box. Most South Africans get post delivered to a rented PO Box, post office or some other designated drop off point. To make matters worse, there is no outlined map of these postal \"areas\" but is determined by local knowledge! To try flesh out the missing data, I decided to add postcodes to node tags that had a designated suburb (further details below)\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Oneway way tags with value other than 'Yes' or 'No'\n",
    "Some way tags had a oneway designation of '-1' so reclassified these as 'unclassified'"

I also decided to run the function before the tag was added to the tag dictionery so this function works for one tag. I used a try and except to catch any street names that were not cleaned and printed a warning statement. The function is found in the clean_functions file."

    "The first step was to build a dictionery  of trusted suburb/postcode key value pairs. I copied the html from the south african postal web service for looking up postcodes (so that I could add the file for my submission) and used Beautiful Soup to parse over the data and create a suburb-postcode dictionery - in the mapping file. After my first run of this, I realised I would need to add the postcodes for some of the surrounding areas, such as Westville. Durban has suffered extensive \"city creep\" over the last 20 years and so some areas that were once (when postcodes were allocated) considered seperate villages, are now part of the greater Durban area. I also know that all postcodes should start with a 40 or 36 so this helped me visually verify that the dictionery I created was not full of incorrect information.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I ran this to catch suburbs that were not on the list, I realised that some of the suburbs were indeed incorrect! Some belonged in Johannesburg and some neither me nor Google had heard of. Whilst it would have been ideal to clean these incorrect ones out, this seemed like a manual job as one would need a verified list of all areas in Durban, which to my knowledge does not exist online. For the purposes of adding in postcodes, I was satisfied that because I had pulled postcodes from the post office site that specified the city to be \"Durban\", I was at least not adding postcodes to only validified areas.\n",

    "# Additional Ideas and Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say the single biggest improvement would be to add more data! The sample project for Charlottesville had almost 1.5 million nodes in comparison to Durban's 19k. More data would allow more robust analysis which could even be used in town planning if it were good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "- only 107 out of 18.5k nodes tags had a street address\n",
    "- only 79 out of 78k ways tags had a street address\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest issues with adding street name data (or any data) is the constantly evolving nature of Durban. The city is still new and growing and so unlike many Western cities, things change quickly. For example, in the last 15 years, a majority of the major roads in Durban changed names to get rid of old colonial and apartheid glorification. The informal sector plays a big role in the economy of South Africa as a whole and so the layout of the city can change in a relatively short time span.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is accessibility - internet access is not a given in South Africa as it is in some countries and can be costly. So for the people who know Durban the best, this can hinder their desire to use precious money for an open source project."
