My Project Submission for the Data Wrangling Course on Udacity (as part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree)

The project aimed to download, clean and wrangle an OpenStreetMap area of your choosing. The code is not a complete analysis but rather aims to satisfy the aims of the project, which ultimately is to demonstrate a knowledge of XML, python, SQL and a curiosity around the data.

For an overview of the results and explanation, look at Data+Wrangling_Project.html

The other html files (all named after a place), were used within the code (see more below).

the csv files were an intermediary output used to have a look at data structure

DB.db is the database containing cleaned nodes, ways and node tags

xml2csv.py is the main script that runs the process, all other python files are helper to this.
